### About me

My name is Chakravarthi Kanduri. I am currently starting as a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/) at the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/). My research would focus on the development and application of computational methods/tools for analysing biological data. [Geir Kjetil Sandve](http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/people/aca/geirksa/) would be my supervisor. 

Previously, I received a bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from the [Andhra University](http://andhrauniversity.edu.in/index.html) in 2009, and a master's degree in Bioinformatics from the [Aalto University School of Science](http://sci.aalto.fi/en/) in 2012, and a doctoral degree (PhD) in Computational Biology from the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) in 2015. [Irma J채rvel채](https://tuhat.halvi.helsinki.fi/portal/en/persons/irma-jarvela(4c752715-87c4-4ec0-8f33-b0fd2c7c4627).html) and [Harri L채hdesm채ki](http://research.ics.aalto.fi/csb/index.shtml) were my supervisors during PhD. During my PhD, I applied [computational and statistical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) to analyse and interpret genomics and transcriptomics datasets.
